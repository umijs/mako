# @utoo/pack

> 🌖 High-performance bundler core for the Utoo toolchain, powered by [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack).

`@utoo/pack` is the engine behind the Utoo build system. It leverages the incremental computation power of Turbopack and the performance of Rust to provide a lightning-fast development and build experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Extreme Performance**: Core bundling logic implemented in Rust via NAPI-RS.
- 🛠️ **Turbopack Powered**: Built on top of the same engine that powers Next.js Turbopack.
- 🔌 **Webpack Compatibility**: Support for consuming `webpack.config.js` to simplify migration from Webpack.
- 📦 **Modern Web Support**: Native support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules, Less, Sass, and more.
- 🔧 **Extensible Architecture**: Support for custom loaders, plugins, and flexible configuration.
- 🔄 **Fast HMR**: Instant updates during development with optimized Hot Module Replacement.

## ✨ Supported Features

`@utoo/pack` aims for high compatibility with the Webpack ecosystem while providing superior performance.

- **Entry**: Supports `name`, `import`, and `filename` templates.
- **Module Rules**: Support for most mainstream Webpack loaders via `loader-runner`.
- **Resolve**: Full support for `alias` and `extensions`.
- **Styles**: Built-in support for Less, Sass, PostCSS, CSS Modules, and LightningCSS.
- **Optimization**: Minification, Tree Shaking, Module Concatenation, and more.
- **Frameworks**: Optimized for React (including `styled-jsx`, `styled-components`).
- **Tools**: Integrated Bundle Analyzer and Tracing Logs.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
ut install @utoo/pack --save-dev
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Programmatic API

You can use `@utoo/pack` directly in your Node.js scripts:

```javascript
const { build, serve } = require('@utoo/pack');

// Production build
async function runBuild() {
  await build({
    config: {
      entry: [
        {
          import: "./src/index.ts",
          html: {
            template: "./index.html"
          }
        }
      ],
      output: {
        path: "./dist",
        filename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
        chunkFilename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
        clean: true
      },
      sourceMaps: true
    }
  });
}

// Development mode with HMR
async function startDev() {
  const server = await serve({
    config: {
      entry: [
        {
          import: "./src/index.ts",
          html: {
            template: "./index.html"
          }
        }
      ],
      output: {
        path: "./dist",
        filename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
        chunkFilename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
        clean: true
      },
      sourceMaps: true
    }
  });
  return server;
}
```

`serve()` resolves after the initial build and HTTP startup with a handle containing
`port`, `hostname`, `writeAllEntrypointsToDisk()` and `close()`. Integrations can
await `writeAllEntrypointsToDisk()` before publishing build results and await
`close()` to release the HTTP server, HMR connections and project resources.
Calling `close()` does not exit the process. To manage the surrounding process
yourself, pass `{ port: 3000, handleSignals: false }` as the fourth argument.

## 🔌 Webpack Compatibility Mode

`@utoo/pack` provides a partial compatibility layer for Webpack.

```javascript
const { build } = require('@utoo/pack');
const webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config.js');

async function run() {
  await build({ ...webpackConfig, webpackMode: true });
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Webpack features and plugins are supported. Check the [Features List](./docs/features-list.md) for details on supported configuration options.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The bundler can be configured via a `utoopack.json` or through the programmatic API. Key configuration areas include:

- **`entry`**: Define your application entry points.
- **`define`**: Build-time variable replacement.
- **`externals`**: Exclude specific dependencies from the bundle.
- **`server.externals`**: Replace top-level externals for server entries and Server Functions. If
  omitted, server builds continue to use top-level `externals`.
- **`devServer.browserToTerminal`**: Forward browser console output to the development terminal.
  Use `"error"`, `"warn"`, `true`, or `false`; standalone Utoopack defaults to `false`.
- **`mode`**: `development` or `production`.

For a full list of options, see the [Configuration Schema](./config_schema.json).

Production client builds default to short content-hashed JS and CSS chunk names,
using Turbopack's 13-character base38 hash (for example, `<hash>.js` or
`turbopack-<hash>.js` for entry runtimes). Development builds retain readable names.
Explicit `output.filename`, `output.chunkFilename`, and `output.cssFilename`
templates take precedence; use `filename: "[name].js"` when consumers require
stable entry filenames. Static assets, copied files, server builds, and library
builds keep their existing naming rules. A deployment's complete URL also includes
its public path and any query parameters, so short chunk names alone do not
guarantee a particular URL length limit.

Set `optimization.sharedRuntime: true` to emit one browser runtime asset shared
across production application entries. This reduces duplicated runtime code in
multi-entry builds and lets pages reuse the cached runtime. Each entry keeps its
own small bootstrap script. The option defaults to `false` because separating the
runtime adds a request for a single entry; it does not apply to development,
Node.js, or library builds.

```json
{
  "mode": "production",
  "optimization": {
    "sharedRuntime": true
  }
}
```
